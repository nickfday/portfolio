            <p class="intro">Hello and welcome to my online portfolio. My name is Nick Finley-Day and I’m a Multimedia Developer with over five years of experience in freelance projects and working for commercial agencies.<p>   
            <p>I take pride my ability to work on both the creative and technical sides of the multimedia industry. I have a solid understanding in a variety of programming languages, as well as a keen eye for graphic design. I also have a BSc in Multimedia and Digital Systems from the University of Sussex.</p>
            <p>I created this site primarily to showcase my work. This is a responsive website meaning it should render just fine whether you are viewing this on a desktop, tablet, mobile or any other device (you can test this by resizing the browser window and see the content respond). I believe responsive design to be the future of digital production.</p>
            <p>Below is an online CV or resume of my professional career to date. Each position has taught me invaluable lessons and for the most part has been extremely positive. I see myself as an all-round 'techy', I have experience in project briefs, brain-storming, design, development, client support and just about all aspects of the project lifecycle.</p>
            <p>I have spent this year working in Sydney, Australia. I've always wanted to work abroad and feel priviledged to have done so in such a magnificent city. I've been made to feel very welcome as another 'pommy' in Oz and cannot thank my employers and colleagues enough.</p>
            
            <p><!--I am currently seeking contract work in Sydney. I am here on a working holiday visa which expires in November 2013.--> If you are interested in my services please email me at <a href="mailto:nickfday@gmail.com">nickfday@gmail.com</a>.</p>

            <p>This role involved working closely with Drupal and Moodle frameworks. As well as honing my front end skills it was exciting to fully discover the power of Drupal. I have been building on this knowledge in my spare time and will ideally make use of this in future roles. Another highlight of this job  was using the version control system GIT and making use of its impressively powerful local branching, staging areas and multiple work flows.</p>

    		<h3>Dec 12 - Jan 13 <a href="http://www.sphealth.com/">SP Health</a></h3> 
            <h4>Sydney, Australia</h4>      
        	<p class="intro">I arrived in Sydney in November 2012. After almost 5 months off, I was more than ready to get back into the web development world and start applying my trade for the first time outside British soil.<p>
        	<p>Within 2 weeks I was fortunate enough to secure an apartment and a short-term contract. The contract was with SP Health who are the creators of The Biggest Loser online diet clubs in Australia, Asia and the UK.</p>  
            <p>I was brought in to help the team build two new websites being launched in the new year. This involved working in an agile environment with sites powered by .NET technology. As well as my usual bread and butter HTML/CSS/Javascript, I also had some exposure to building for mobile and .NET.</p>
            <p>I was responsible for building the frontend of these projects, liasing with project managers, designers and .NET developers. I built the entire frontend of The Promise which was then passed to the .NET team to implement backend features. Links to my work are provided below. I built a high proportion of pages that are visible on Click Diet website in addition to the mobile site. I was also involved in the building the new designs to The Biggest Loser Club, Australia’s No. 1 weight loss website.</p>

            <p>During my time here I was responsible building the core site structure and styling a large proportion of the site.

I spent time developing a key feature using the Google Maps V3 API and customised a video interview recording and playback application. This involved a lot of javascript coding.</p>

            <p>My first contract job was at Gyro's swanky office in Chelsea. Slightly different to my previous work this was solely creating HTML emailers to major clients such as HP, FedEx and Virgin to name a few. For this I had to abandon my usual modern-day programming methods to old-school, table based builds. Learning how to build HTML emailers that render perfectly in every email client was a learning experience and made me appreciate how things were done in the 90s. That being said I much prefer building for web/mobile than email.</p>

            <p class="intro">I was approached to build the website for Always a Chance, a new charity that aims to prevent violent crime amongst the nation’s youth. I also built a site for their 92 Club Relay fundraiser which saw thousands of people taking part in a relay to all 92 football clubs in England.</p>
            <p>The sites were built using wordpress with a blank theme I created. We chose Wordpress as blogging was key to both sites and the vast library of plugins saved a lot of development time. The use of advanced custom fields allowed flexible content that could be managed by non-techy’s using the intuitive administrator view.</p>
            <p>I do not see myself as an expert backend developer however creating two dynamic sites from scratch did require considerable PHP coding and MySQL management. In addition to this there are demonstrations of the Google Maps API, social media  integration and plugin development.</p>

            <p class="intro">
            Moving to a smaller agency gave me a lot of responsibility. The senior developer I was supposed to learn from left shortly after I arrived so I was effectively the lead developer just over a year after graduating. Needless to say I had my hands full.</p>
           
            <div class="twelve columns">
            <p>I worked among a range of projects for clients such as o2, Fremantle Media and Lloyds TSB. A lot of the sites were powered by CMS’s dotnetnuke and Modx, both of which I had to learn fast. This company went all out with their pitches and being part of this was an exciting experience. Quite often I had to build on-the-fly microsites for desktop, tablets and mobile to be shown off at pitches.</p>
            <p>I worked on an online publication for Fremantle Media called Connect Magazine. This is an interactive magazine I built using Flash Actionscript 3. Previous editions were built in AS2 so the decision was made to build from scratch and use this as a template for future projects. A few months after launch the site won two awards from The Institute of Internal Communication including the Gold award of Excellence.</p>
